# Prop Drilling & Context API Approaches

A simple React project demonstrating two methods for passing data in a React application: **Prop Drilling** and **Context API**. The application takes a username input, show it on the screen after login.

## Project Overview

This project is built with React and showcases:
- **Prop Drilling**: Passing props down through multiple levels of components to reach the desired component.
- **Context API**: Using React's Context API to manage and share state globally across components, avoiding the need for prop drilling.
